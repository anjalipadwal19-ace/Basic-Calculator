How to Use the Calculator
1.	Open index.html in any web browser.
2.	Click the number buttons to enter values.
3.	Use operators like + , − , × , ÷ , xʸ to perform calculations.
4.	Press = to get the result.
5.	Use C to clear the display.
6.	Memory buttons:
o	MC – Clear memory
o	MR – Recall stored value
o	M+ – Add current value to memory
o	M- – Subtract current value from memory
7.	Use √ for square root and % for percentage calculation.
